all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at

specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious

gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple

previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were
found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high

composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock
interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These
calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example
calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects
of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and

objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches

outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the

Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated

theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or
intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most
commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,

$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant
curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global
definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various
relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler
manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved
globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting
identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the
curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely
global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local
counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special

secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with
an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.

individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04

nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the

space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms

(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0
(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only

The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the

from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS
2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time
render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.
On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states
of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in
the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the
H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the
V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary
to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of
November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability
episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare
with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.

We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric
characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination
angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like
emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around
all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations
between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us
address the question of classification of ""interacting SNe"" and the possibility
of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.

The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed
broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of

dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf
stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the
spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is
obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star

distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis

times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time

particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some

their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's

including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu

significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.

This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a

between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the

that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high

In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are

however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in

use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale

these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the
locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not

properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray

work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra

Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through

resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved

that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,

[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density

ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line

differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in

also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended

vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.

their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear

New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget

Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a
steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when
considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find
that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial

grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present

of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN

improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate

entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is

identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.

for modeling the variability of high energy sources such as blazars is becoming
a high priority. We point out the serious, innate problems one zone
synchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. We
then present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, time
delayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account.
By introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, our
code can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situation
typical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproduce
variability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeV
flares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.

Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2

recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.

spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.

turnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the

the stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density

variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and
fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays
produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are
similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.
We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with
certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that

  curve",J. London Math. Soc. 78(2008) 418-440,math.AG,"  For a smooth projective curve, the cycles of e-secant k-planes are among the
most studied objects in classical enumerative geometry and there are well-known
formulas due to Castelnuovo, Cayley and MacDonald concerning them. Despite
various attempts, surprisingly little is known about the enumerative validity
of such formulas. The aim of this paper is to completely clarify this problem
in the case of the generic curve C of given genus. Using degeneration
techniques and a few facts about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of
stable pointed curves we determine precisely under which conditions the cycle
of e-secant k-planes in non-empty and we compute its dimension. We also
precisely determine the dimension of the variety of linear series on C carrying
e-secant k-planes. In a different direction, in the last part of the paper we
study the distribution of ramification points of the powers of a line bundle on
C having prescribed ramification at a given point.

conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central
point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank

a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold

However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this

despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate

unknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining
the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much
more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant
calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely
date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical
interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first
meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also
comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational
lensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in
his path towards general relativity.

the smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator

initial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted
entangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local
ancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct
Schmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large

measuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent

  Follow-Up Observation","Astrophys.J.661:1202-1207,2007",astro-ph,"  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for
planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the
probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the
lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we
consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim

protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150
g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have
aggregated to 1 micron in size.

ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\it
ankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair
production on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dip
scenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a
clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim
10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic
protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which
scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino
background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim
10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray
sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information
on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected
sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of
cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases

dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also

results are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\to 0$. In addition, we
have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix
elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be
constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The
intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through
the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated
with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the

by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of
$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the

decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective
$\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct
CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the
latter. (iii) For $B\to K\pi\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant

cases of standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in

right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is
used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or
inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze
how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We
suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The

problem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The
generalized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness
of the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other

stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which are associated with the young
star-forming region N11. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated
fitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the
genetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 and
LH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation
scenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample
contains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be
~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs
and giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating
evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient
rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to
an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings
for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such
mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly
(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be
intermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and
comparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good
agreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) <
6.1.

from Jefferson Lab (HAPPEx and G0), when combined with the $\nu p$ elastic
cross section data from Brookhaven (E734), permit an extraction of the
strangeness contribution to the vector and axial nucleon form factors for
momentum transfers in the range $0.45 < Q^2 < 1.0$ GeV$^2$. These results,
combined with the recent determination of the strange vector form factors at
$Q^2 = 0.1$ GeV$^2$ (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4, G0) have been interpreted in terms
of $uuds\bar{s}$ configurations very different from the kaon-loop
configurations usually associated with strangeness in the nucleon. New
experiments are being proposed to improve the state of our knowledge of the
$\nu p$ elastic cross section -- these new experiments will push the range of
$Q^2$ to much lower values, and greatly increase the precision of the $\nu p$
elastic data. One outcome of this can be a measurement of the strangeness
contribution to the nucleon spin, $\Delta s$. Nuclear targets (e.g. C or Ar)
are to be used in these neutrino experiments, and so a deep understanding of
the nuclear physics, particularly in regard to final state effects, is needed
before the potential of these precision experiments can be fully realized.

applied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,
second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the
period-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in
the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the
two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first
time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,
period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a
square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,
\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for
the critical isotherm, \delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies
that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size
scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period
provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,
for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a
fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature
T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and
field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use
of the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,

  stratification and the velocity distribution anisotropy","A&A, 445, 735, 2006",astro-ph,"  The effect of the electron density stratification on the intensity profiles
of the H I Ly-$\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar
coronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large
scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona
at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to
determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar
corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The
main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the
coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun
from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are
sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.
However, Ly-$\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The
calculated total intensities of Ly-$\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a
lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed
ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed
profiles of Ly-$\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered
electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few
stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data
result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close
to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions
are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered

photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent
of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the
requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the
models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,
the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming
more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period
interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the

Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong

we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this

the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations
frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres
of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results
indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease
significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when
compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation
approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter,
which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We
present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected

multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which

twelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between
~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different
parts of the SMC such as the ""Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In
this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields
through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We
find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF
analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these
parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in
the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern
fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the
CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred
from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are
dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack
of a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate
that a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed
fields.

collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have
steep negative exponential potentials. The scale invariance of the spectrum is
realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability
drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old
ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition
from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse
automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling
solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The
final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the
Hubble scale at the transition.

  62-67",cond-mat.stat-mech,"  The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely
noise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and
white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The
potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field
approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the
``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'
statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that
whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of
self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting
effect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.

possible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.

solving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.

galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We
assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is
transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical
model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of
star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and
their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two
distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks
and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to
as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion
disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We
find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion
rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and
slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely
halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a
stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent
short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN
lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies
and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central
black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the

one. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring
monotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\gamma_L, \gamma_S$ and
$\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\delta =

704.1255,"Thomas Peters, Joerg Schumacher",Two-way coupling of FENE dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow,"Phys. Fluids, 19 (2007) 065109",physics.flu-dyn nlin.CD,"  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)
dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a
set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The
dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the
streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched
referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate
the local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.

nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy
cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating
operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard
Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,
quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating
that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic
heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum
gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation
for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge
symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,
such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed
neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the
electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These
requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic
heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a
U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of
left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.
The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future
experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton
decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension
four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number
violating operators and R-parity violation.

main driving force of computation. This is in contrast with the more
traditional circuit model which is based on unitary operations. Among

  We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum

denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning
locally and compositionally about these patterns.
  We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which
allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form.
Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture
based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by
exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.
  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:
Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of
them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory
we develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework
we have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is
not just particular to the one-way quantum computer.

graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same
color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be

reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the

transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially
rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The
predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The
radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and
~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of
interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted
angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little
viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be
required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models
illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the
buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes
is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or
may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes
of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier
elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,
recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the
short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to
explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst
properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.
The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important
for triggering and fueling superbursts. (abridged)

in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While
the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks
do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by
2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two
stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O
stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no
obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our
observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud
has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O
stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears
to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type
(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.

  Methods: Time-resolved V-band CCD photometry was obtained for seven nights

  Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined
orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the
observations, BH Lyn was in high-state with V~15.5 mag. The star presents ~1.5
mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb.
  The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This
is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution
variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion
disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also
possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are
detected in two long runs in 2000. A possible connection between SW Sex and
negative superhump phenomena through the presence of tilted accretion disc is
discussed, and a way to observationally test this is suggested.

km/s towards the sightline HD 30677 with NHI=1.7x10^19 cm-2 has no
corresponding CaII K absorption, which has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of
610. The star has a spectroscopically determined distance of 2.7-kpc, and hence
sets this as a firm lower distance limit towards Anti-Centre cloud ACII.
Towards another sightline (HD 46185), HI at +122 km/s and NHI=1.2x10^19 cm-2 is
seen. The CaII K spectrum has a S/N = 780, although no absorption is observed
at the cloud velocity. This similarly places a firm lower distance limit of
2.9-kpc towards this parcel of gas that may be an intermediate velocity cloud.
The lack of intermediate velocity (IV) CaII K absorption towards HD 196426 at a
S/N = 500 reinforces a lower distance limit of 700-pc towards this part of
Complex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km/s. Additionally,
no IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong
in HI with NHI=8x10^19 cm-2 at -42 km/s, placing a firm although uninteresting
lower distance limit of 39-pc to this part of IV South. Finally, no HV CaII K

particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting
results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a

adiabatically, then a dense ""spike"" of dark matter is expected to have formed
around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH
can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to
annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even
exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus
predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. ""WIMP burners"", in the vicinity
of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners
are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate
cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the
existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its
density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP
burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core
masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the
observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be
consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We
also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of
gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark
matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the
EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision
measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter
spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent
limits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.

energy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and
derive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the
prompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared
within different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high
energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock
energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).
For very small values of $\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be
comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.
However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required
to account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs
are therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk
Lorentz factor (e.g. $\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\sim 10$ GeV are
attenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even
higher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -
PeV due to $\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux
level is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these

We show that in the lowest Landau level approximation, some of the coordinates

Our construction is applied to a minimal extension of the standard model. It is
shown that the Higgs sector might be non-commutative whereas the remaining
sectors of the standard model remain commutative. Signatures of this model at
the LHC are discussed. We then discuss an application to a dark matter sector
coupled to the Higgs sector of the standard model and show that here again,
dark matter could be non-commutative, the standard model fields remaining

with the idea of a renewal of the relaxing entities after this critical time.
In the five cases where one can fit accurately, the temperature dependence of
the high-barrier cutoff follows the shoving model. The Johari-Goldstein peaks,
seen in four of our seven cases, are describable in terms of gaussians in the
barrier density, superimposed on the high-frequency tail of the

the same peak positions and widths of these gaussians, but in general a

the real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,
and roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (""the
${\mathbb{K}}$-axis"") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension
$\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\thickapprox\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation
$\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\to\mathbb{K}(\alpha)$.
  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of
the specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,
via $\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a

infinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of
circles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the
dimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many
${\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.
Moreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation
of hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of

explicitly show that, assumed a given mass spectrum: linear Regge behavior in
$n$ (the principal quantum number) plus corrections in $1/n$, we can obtain the
logarithmic (and constant) behavior in $n$ of the decay constants within a
systematic expansion in $1/n$. Our example shows that it is possible to have
different large $n$ behavior for the vector and pseudo-vector mass spectrum and
yet comply with all the constraints from the operator product expansion.

detection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels may
be unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a
20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developed
for the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we
seek an extended international collaboration:
  (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn
focussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC
accelerator improvement program;
  (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis
from the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is
under consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;
  (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an
increase in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully
considered. It is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a set
of many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, ""cloning"" the technology of
the T600. Further phases may foresee extensions of MODULAr to meet future
physics goals.
  The experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided a
new hall is excavated in the vicinity of the Gran Sasso Laboratory and adequate

intrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly
oriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.
However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of
theories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates
a significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action
equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple
to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB
gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the
Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not
apply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the
Hayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called
Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of
this theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for
the torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with
the spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either
ghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems
can be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition
choosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This
yields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction
principle is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does
not couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji
theory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There
may be other torsion theories which do.

used in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known
pitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a
consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying
a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss
function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the
loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the
framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that
setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in
finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator
introduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather
poorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to
maximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator
is tuned to sparsity.

  fluids","Phys. Rev. E 75, 051708 (2007).",cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft,"  In this article we calculate the surface phase diagram of a two-dimensional
hard-rod fluid confined between two hard lines. In a first stage we study the
semi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single
hard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the
wall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard
walls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.
For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even
for very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model
used was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure
Functional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation
approximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked
experimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical
motions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between
the grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which
entropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface
phenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.

more realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to
examine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in
semi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral
mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc
cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump
cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We
compare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to
faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented
durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass
ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved
simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump
period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed
black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower
disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to
higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous
dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the
disc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,
the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new
equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We
quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.
We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show
that the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.

Extremely energetic particles have a unique and well-defined distribution f(x)

molecular gases; f(x) is not smooth but has multiple singularities. The latter
behavior is sensitive to material properties such as the collision parameters,
the moment of inertia and the collision rate. Interestingly, there are
preferred ratios of rotational-to-total energy. In general, f(x) is strongly
correlated with energy and the deviations from a uniform distribution grow with
energy. We also solve for the energy distribution of freely cooling Maxwell
Molecules and find qualitatively similar behavior.

interaction is incorporated through the solution of the Lippmann Schwinger
equation using an elastic scattering matrix element, $T_{\eta d \to \eta d}$,
which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form,
with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an
effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of
this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev
equation solution for the $\eta NN$ system corresponding to different $\eta-N$
scattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few body
equations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate $T_{\eta d \to
\eta d}$. The $p-d$ final state interaction is included in the spirit of the
Watson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of
the Jost function. The $\eta-d$ interaction is found to be dominant in the
region of small invariant $\eta -d$ mass, $M_{\eta d}$. The $p-d$ interaction
enhances the cross section in the whole region of $M_{\eta d}$, but is larger

waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy

driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.

distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large

intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to

younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of

  Estimators?",Econometric Theory 24 (2008),math.ST stat.ME stat.TH,"  We consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of a
post-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator
here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model
(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing
procedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by
least-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show
that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with
reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no
estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).
This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance
of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the
probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower
bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the
situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the
distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection
estimator.

fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to
the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the

simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the
iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The
data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,
but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that
this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the
narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a
diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation
between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely

astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,
magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization
measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst
several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.
In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization

the proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use
Geant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus

polarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals
using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,
for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is
assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for
weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be
rejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%

X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main
peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt
emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.
The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from
1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The
optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather
than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED
shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour
might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities
similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The
afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.
Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are
consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is
the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a

HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon
scattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,
the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually
an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard
X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),
the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also
in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]
  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering
contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in
terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established
theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the
basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical
translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice
versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This
PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the
H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.
  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to
compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the
PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse
problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror
surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows
establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given

  one-plate planets","Geophysical Journal International 172 (2), 817-841 (2008)",physics.geo-ph physics.space-ph,"  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the
lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

not find a hot spot or gas stream around the outer boundaries of the accretion

double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value that
is in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in the
ultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al. (1998). We present also a new method
to obtain K_2, which enhances the detection of absorption or emission features
arising in the late-type companion. Our results are compared with published
values derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison of
the TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit is
obtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at that
spectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect
accurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em =
107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by
Zhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD =

on the separation of the double emission peaks, we calculate an outer disk

= 1.5 Myr) whose most likely source was a nearby supernova. Previous models of
Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse
of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,
that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very
close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.
We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions
related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close
supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations
demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to
escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss
occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the
disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These
low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the
high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk
before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be
consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On
the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into
dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be
injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic
abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are
consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1
pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.

applying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different

varying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB

occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls
state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from
the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from
the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by
changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band

with redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their
spectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity
Function up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with
previous results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our
data, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us
to constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By
combining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted
from the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different
evolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the
combined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is
a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived
from the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the
AGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the
excess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we
find, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that
the peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift
going to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of
X-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of ""AGN cosmic

project were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont
telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Careful attention in reduction and
analysis was paid to the illumination correction, background subtraction, point
spread function determination, and galaxy subtraction. ICL flux is detected in
both bands in all ten clusters ranging from 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11}
h^{-1} solar luminosities in r and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar
luminosities in the B-band. These fluxes account for 6 to 22% of the total
cluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the
B-band. Average ICL B-r colors range from 1.5 to 2.8 mags when k and evolution
corrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group
environments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1} Mpc distant from the
cluster center. Our sample, having been selected from the Abell sample, is
incomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density,
low flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high
flux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations
between ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do
find that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally
concentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is
consistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or
forming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.

growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or
transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels
of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to
investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.
Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,
and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the
analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the
exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer
system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the
abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic
network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in
different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,
fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate
elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely
shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study
metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks
which are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for
bioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.

5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. However
only a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmitted
through the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of the
maximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass
function. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya
emission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters
in which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results
in a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation
with a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift
observations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the
following eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with
plausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star
formation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,
v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at
z=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the
observed correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the
observed anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very
massive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the
galaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate
the presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop

$\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of
astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state

three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of

calls into question the validity of the constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state
in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across
hydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover
primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative
ones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic
numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.
Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including
magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using
different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a
realistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when
transitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these

is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based

decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the
CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the
self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force
are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at

a restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition
single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically
~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.
These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories

role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering
transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri

rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of

kilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state
reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO
peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single

have only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency
is higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly
suggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in
LMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the
highest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc

  boundary","Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 200603 (2007)",cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft,"  We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with
a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions,
that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells,
are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both
the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from
the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual
particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We
discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding
proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar

704.177,"L. V. Sales, J. F. Navarro, M. G. Abadi and M. Steinmetz","Satellites of Simulated Galaxies: survival, merging, and their relation
  to the dark and stellar halos","Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc.379:1464-1474,2007",astro-ph,"  We study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite of
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a LCDM universe. We find
little spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellite
population. The velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator of
the virial velocity of the halo: \sigma_{sat}/V_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to
the Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s and
V_{vir}^{M31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than the
rotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulated
satellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellar
halo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the
population of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite
depends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased
toward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our
results support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences
between stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive
``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,
and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that
has survived self-bound until the present.
