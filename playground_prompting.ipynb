The study includes simulations over the unmodified airfoil\\nand modified airfoil operating at Re=120000 using kT-kL-{\\\\omega} based Delayed\\nDetached Eddy Simulation (DDES) model. The calculations include both the\\npre-stall and post-stall regions, while the performance of the mean flow\\naerodynamic properties like pressure, lift, skin-friction, and drag\\ncoefficients are also investigated in the presence of tubercles. The spanwise\\nflow over the modified airfoil interacts with the primary flow. The turbulent\\nseparation gets delayed compared to the unmodified airfoil, thereby\\nsignificantly improving the stall behavior and flow behavior in the post-stall\\nregion. The modified airfoil provides the gradual stall behavior against the\\nsteep stall behavior for the unmodified airfoil. To optimize tubercle\\nconfiguration, the study considers two modified airfoils with different\\ncombinations of amplitude and wavelength. The unsteady analysis, including the\\nreduced-order modeling, i.e. 3D Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD),\\ncharacterizes the dominant vortical structure of the flow to evaluate the\\nimprovement in the aerodynamic performance of the modified airfoil.

      "    \"abstract\": \"  The main objective of this paper is to present a general mathematical model\\nand an associated numerical algorithm applicable to an arbitrary fixed-wing\\nfixed-mass aircraft undergoing an arbitrary maneuver, based on the 3D nonlinear\\ncoupled differential-algebraic equations of motion, including force, moment,\\nkinematic and constraint equations. The model is formulated to address the\\ninverse simulation problem where a target maneuver is prescribed and the\\ncorresponding time dependent patterns of the control variables are solved for\\nto meet this maneuver. The model utilizes two different moving frames of\\nreferences, namely the body axes and the wind axes. The numerical algorithm\\nfeatures sequential solution of equations in a fully explicit manner. It is\\nstraightforward to use the model in a reverse mode, namely the direct\\nsimulation problem. The inverse problem may be summarized as follows: Inputs:\\nTime history of desired-trajectory rectangular coordinates relative to the\\nground-fixed axes. A constraint should be specified, which we arbitrarily chose\\nit to be the bank angle. Also, certain geometric and aerodynamic aircraft data\\nare needed. Outputs: Time history of the control variables (thrust magnitude,\\nelevator angle, rudder angle, ailerons angle), which will satisfy the aimed\\ntrajectory. The paper finally applies the presented numerical algorithm to a\\nroll maneuver for the Mirage-III fighter.\\n\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"  The study of cavity flow is one of the most important research topics of\\nunsteady aerodynamics. Supersonic turbulent flows over a cavity are mostly\\nencountered in missiles, turbomachinery, and high-speed aircraft. The\\nturbulence inside the cavity gives rise to excess drag, acoustic waves,\\npressure fluctuations, and vibrations which may lead to numerous problems like\\nexcess fuel consumption, failure of missile trajectory or mechanical parts, and\\naerodynamic heating. We conduct numerical simulations to investigate the flow\\nand compare our results to existing experimental data to show quantitative\\nvalidation. We then investigate the effect of the Mach number of the turbulent\\nsupersonic flow on the pressure contours and the vortical structures inside the\\ncavity and the subsequent effect on other flow parameters like acoustic waves.\\nThereafter, we propose two modifications of the cavity geometry, a) slanted\\nedges and b) smoothened corners with slanted edges, to improve the aerodynamic\\nperformance. ANSYS ICEM tool has been used for the fine mesh generation of our\\ncavity geometry and all the simulation was run on ANSYS fluent software. The K\\nomega SST turbulence model was used for the simulation as it can capture the\\nnear wall property with reasonable accuracy and a grid independence study was\\ncarried out to find the correct solution of the Navier Stokes equation was\\nproceeding by the solver. The parameters like pressure contours, streamline\\npattern, coefficient of pressure distribution and sound pressure level (SPL)\\nhas been found and compared for both modified and unmodified open cavity at\\ndifferent Mach number. The modifications suggested show a significant\\nimprovement over the open cavity designs in the mean pressure distribution and\\nsound pressure level distributions.\\n\",\n",

      "    \"type\": \"paper\",\n",
      "    \"year\": 2021,\n",
      "    \"abstract\": \"  The aerodynamic design of modern civil aircraft requires a true sense of\\nintelligence since it requires a good understanding of transonic aerodynamics\\nand sufficient experience. Reinforcement learning is an artificial general\\nintelligence that can learn sophisticated skills by trial-and-error, rather\\nthan simply extracting features or making predictions from data. The present\\npaper utilizes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the policy for\\nreducing the aerodynamic drag of supercritical airfoils. The policy is designed\\nto take actions based on features of the wall Mach number distribution so that\\nthe learned policy can be more general. The initial policy for reinforcement\\nlearning is pretrained through imitation learning, and the result is compared\\nwith randomly generated initial policies. The policy is then trained in\\nenvironments based on surrogate models, of which the mean drag reduction of 200\\nairfoils can be effectively improved by reinforcement learning. The policy is\\nalso tested by multiple airfoils in different flow conditions using\\ncomputational fluid dynamics calculations. The results show that the policy is\\neffective in both the training condition and other similar conditions, and the\\npolicy can be applied repeatedly to achieve greater drag reduction.\\n\",\n",
