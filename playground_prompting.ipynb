The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

For examining the effects of BAN energy gel, eleven Thai male runners (aged 27.36\\u00b18.89 years and VO2 max 69.43\\u00b112.69 ml/kg/min) participated in this study to investigate Time To Exhaustion (TTE). TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

The compounds were characterized and quantified using NMR, Mass Spectroscopy (MS) and HPLC. A crude ethanolic extract of 124 g, containing 5.3 % of rutin, was obtained from 1 kg of dried banana leaf powder. After a series of solvent partition separations, the product from partitions using hexane/dichloromethane and dichloromethane/water in sequence contained a rutin content of 40.6 %. Purification using a Sephadex column yielded fractions with purity of rutin up to 74\\u201384 % and further purification using semi-preparative RP-HPLC produced a final product with a yield of rutin of 32.4 mg/g of the crude extracts and a purity of 98.4 %.

Gel containing 15% w/w of starch was prepared from rice starch, tapioca starch or blended rice starch/tapioca starch (1:0.85 w/w) mixed with water, 45oBx sucrose solution or coconut milk. The result showed that rice starch gel stored at 4 \\u00b0C had highest hardness, degree of syneresis and melting enthalpy of the retrograded structure (\\u0394Hret). Degree of syneresis of frozen rice starch gels subjected to several freezing-thawing cycles was also highest. Under chilled temperature storage, starch gels containing sucrose or coconut milk had higher hardness and denser gel structure, comparing to the starch gels in water. This textural change was due to greater degree of starch retrogradation, sucrose recrystallization and/or formation of amylose-lipid complex crystallites shown in X-ray diffractograms. However, addition of highly concentrated sucrose or coconut milk increased freeze-thaw stability of the frozen starch gels, as shown by decreasing degree of syneresis.

Treatment at 55oC slowed softening, but induced peel damage and failure to develop a normal color. Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced.

For application in ice cream, microcapsules of probiotic encapsulated with KGMH at concentration of 25% with and without 10% (w/w) trehalose were then mixed into milk ice cream separately. The ice cream was stored at -18\\u00b0C for one month. The survival rate of microencapsulated probiotic cells and free cells probiotics in the ice cream were measured. It was found that microcapsule of KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) with 10% (w/w) trehalose gave higher survival rate of probiotics cell (> 90%) in ice cream under freezing temperature than KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) and free cell probiotics during storage, respectively.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In the present study, a novel solid base catalyst derived from desert banana (Musa sapientum Linn) peels was used as a catalyst for biodiesel production. The catalyst was calcined at several temperatures between 550\\u2013650 \\u00b0C under atmosphere pressure for 4 h. The composition, structure and texture of the calcined banana peel (CBP) catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The fatty acid profile of the feed soybean oil and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) product composition was analyzed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The prepared catalysts were then applied for the catalytic transesterification of soybean oil with methanol under microwave-assisted heating to form FAME. The effect of the calcination temperature in the catalyst preparation, the catalyst loading level, reaction time, methanol: soybean oil molar ratio and catalyst reusability on the FAME yield were determined by univariate analysis. The CBP catalyst synthesized at 600 \\u00b0C exhibited the highest catalytic activity, since the calcined ash was rich in K, P, Ca and Mg which formed a basic heterogenous catalyst at this calcination temperature. At the determined optimal reaction condition (1 wt.% catalyst loading level, 12:1 molar ratio of methanol: soybean oil, and a 2 min of reaction time under 300 W microwave irradiation) a FAME yield of 99.3% was obtained. Furthermore, the catalyst showed a good reusability with a biodiesel yield of more than 80.7% after four uses.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"One of the most promising methods to produce graphene in large scale is the use of chemical exfoliation together with chemical reduction to achieve reduced graphene oxide. Replacing conventional reducing agents, such as NaBH4 and hydrazine, with cheap, widely available, safe, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-prepare reducing agents is a key to large-scale commercial production of reduced graphene oxide. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing fruit extracts derived from banana peel and juice to reduce graphene oxide. After the reduction, the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide are effectively removed, and the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon bonding networks are restored, as evidenced by the characterization using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our banana extracts would offer a promising pathway for realizing cheap, safe, and environmentally friendly reducing agents for the upscale production of reduced graphene oxide.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Abstract: Extraction of mamao luang (hereafter called mamao) with different solvents and varying solid to liquid (S:L) ratio was conducted to verify its antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content, total monomeric anthocyanin content, and antioxidant activities, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the unrefined extracts, were analyzed. The extraction with 70% acetone and 70% methanol and the S:L ratio of 1:30 seemed to be more appropriate and gave significantly (P < 0.05) higher values of the previously mentioned properties. Whole ground fruits were then incorporated into the blended chicken patties to compare their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). During refrigeration storage of 20 days, the highest level (1,000 mg TPC/kg meat) could retard lipid oxidation relatively comparable to the efficiency of BHA (200 ppm). However, when microbiological aspect was considered together, a limited storage of 12 days was consequently suggested. Practical Application: Mamao fruit is a splendid source of phenolic compounds. The antioxidant properties have been demonstrated using DPPH and FRAP assay. The suitable type of solvent and S:L ratio were provided for the extraction. Our findings have shown that addition of mamao, a source of natural antioxidants, especially at the highest level increased oxidative stability of chicken patties. The research outcomes identify the potential bioactive compound and provide beneficial information related to the feasibility of incorporation of mamao phenolics as antioxidant agents in suitable food matrices. However, further investigation is still required for successful application in meat and meat products.\",\n",

Incorporating 2% CTS-MMT nanocomposites into the free-standing CTS films could improve the water-resistance and oxygen barrier of the film. For the postharvest experiment, CTS and CTS supplemented with CTS-MMT nanocomposite solutions were applied as banana fruit coating by the dipping technique. The CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT showed a significant retarding in peel color change, reduced electrolyte leakage, and MDA content, while CTS coating could maintain fruit firmness and reduce plasma membrane destruction for only the first few days. In addition, the CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT coating could reduce ethylene production and respiration rate of the banana fruit.

BAN has a long history of use as a nutritional supplement and medical food due to its beneficial nutritional and therapeutic effects. Being an ergogenic aid, BAN has shown significant changes in the lipid profile, muscle and liver glycogen, enzyme activity, and Nitric Oxide (NO) activity inhibition, which results in prolonged exercise time. The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\\\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively. BAN energy gel had total energy of 66.75\\\\u00b10.84 Kcal/100 g of sample. For examining the effects of BAN energy gel, eleven Thai male runners (aged 27.36\\\\u00b18.89 years and VO2 max 69.43\\\\u00b112.69 ml/kg/min) participated in this study to investigate Time To Exhaustion (TTE). TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

BAN has a long history of use as a nutritional supplement and medical food due to its beneficial nutritional and therapeutic effects. Being an ergogenic aid, BAN has shown significant changes in the lipid profile, muscle and liver glycogen, enzyme activity, and Nitric Oxide (NO) activity inhibition, which results in prolonged exercise time. The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively. BAN energy gel had total energy of 66.75\\u00b10.84 Kcal/100 g of sample. For examining the effects of BAN energy gel, eleven Thai male runners (aged 27.36\\u00b18.89 years and VO2 max 69.43\\u00b112.69 ml/kg/min) participated in this study to investigate Time To Exhaustion (TTE). TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05). This study found that BAN energy gel can prolong time to exhaustion. Therefore, BAN energy gel can be used as an ergogenic aid for runners, which is suitable to be consumed before and during the competition\",\n",

The firmness of fruits treated at 50oC was higher than that of untreated fruits, and physiological changes including fresh weight loss, ethylene production, total soluble solid content, and peel color were also prevented. Treatment at 55oC slowed softening, but induced peel damage and failure to develop a normal color. Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced. Structural alteration to the peel was also slower than in untreated fruits. The study clarified the effect of hot water treatment on alteration of the cell wall structure and composition of banana fruit during postharvest storage.\",\n",

Replacing conventional reducing agents, such as NaBH4 and hydrazine, with cheap, widely available, safe, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-prepare reducing agents is a key to large-scale commercial production of reduced graphene oxide. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing fruit extracts derived from banana peel and juice to reduce graphene oxide. After the reduction, the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide are effectively removed, and the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon bonding networks are restored, as evidenced by the characterization using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our banana extracts would offer a promising pathway for realizing cheap, safe, and environmentally friendly reducing agents for the upscale production of reduced graphene oxide.\",\n",

HMW-CTS expressed the highest ability to reduce respiration rate and ethylene production of the fruit and preserved fruit firmness by inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes including polygalacturonase and pectate lyase activities which play an important role in pectin degradation. Additionally, HMW-CTS influenced a decrease in disease severity and cell membrane injury in relation to low malondialdehyde content and high antioxidant activities of coated fruit. The overall results suggest that HMW-CTS is a promising postharvest chitosan coating in maintaining fruit firmness and extending the shelf life of \\u2018Hom Thong\\u2019 banana fruit after harvest.\",\n",

The compounds were characterized and quantified using NMR, Mass Spectroscopy (MS) and HPLC. A crude ethanolic extract of 124 g, containing 5.3 % of rutin, was obtained from 1 kg of dried banana leaf powder. After a series of solvent partition separations, the product from partitions using hexane/dichloromethane and dichloromethane/water in sequence contained a rutin content of 40.6 %. Purification using a Sephadex column yielded fractions with purity of rutin up to 74\\u201384 % and further purification using semi-preparative RP-HPLC produced a final product with a yield of rutin of 32.4 mg/g of the crude extracts and a purity of 98.4 %.

For the postharvest experiment, CTS and CTS supplemented with CTS-MMT nanocomposite solutions were applied as banana fruit coating by the dipping technique. The CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT showed a significant retarding in peel color change, reduced electrolyte leakage, and MDA content, while CTS coating could maintain fruit firmness and reduce plasma membrane destruction for only the first few days.

Those costs of performing a computation have long been\\na focus of research in physics, going back to the early work of Landauer. One\\nof the most prominent aspects of computers is that they are inherently\\nnonequilibrium systems. However, the early research was done when\\nnonequilibrium statistical physics was in its infancy, which meant the work was\\nformulated in terms of equilibrium statistical physics. Since then there have\\nbeen major breakthroughs in nonequilibrium statistical physics, which are\\nallowing us to investigate the myriad aspects of the relationship between\\nstatistical physics and computation, extending well beyond the issue of how\\nmuch work is required to erase a bit. In this paper I review some of this\\nrecent work on the `stochastic thermodynamics of computation'. After reviewing\\nthe salient parts of information theory, computer science theory, and\\nstochastic thermodynamics, I summarize what has been learned about the entropic\\ncosts of performing a broad range of computations, extending from bit erasure\\nto loop-free circuits to logically reversible circuits to information ratchets\\nto Turing machines. These results reveal new, challenging engineering problems\\nfor how to design computers to have minimal thermodynamic costs.

      "    \"abstract\": \"  Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in\\nnon-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has\\nbrought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been,\\nhowever, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a\\ncomputer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and\\neven claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we\\nintroduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a\\nphysical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract\\ncomputational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the\\ncomparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in\\nexperimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of\\nthe similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology,\\nleading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical\\nsystem to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that\\nmust be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate\\nthese with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also\\ncovers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer\\nuser. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the\\nrole this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.\\n\",\n",
