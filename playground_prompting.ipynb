The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed.

TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

Treatment at 55oC slowed softening, but induced peel damage and failure to develop a normal color. Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced. Structural alteration to the peel was also slower than in untreated fruits.

In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing fruit extracts derived from banana peel and juice to reduce graphene oxide. After the reduction, the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide are effectively removed, and the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon bonding networks are restored, as evidenced by the characterization using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our banana extracts would offer a promising pathway for realizing cheap, safe, and environmentally friendly reducing agents for the upscale production of reduced graphene oxide.\",\n",

HMW-CTS expressed the highest ability to reduce respiration rate and ethylene production of the fruit and preserved fruit firmness by inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes including polygalacturonase and pectate lyase activities which play an important role in pectin degradation. Additionally, HMW-CTS influenced a decrease in disease severity and cell membrane injury in relation to low malondialdehyde content and high antioxidant activities of coated fruit.

Musa sapientum Linn. or Kluai Namwa (banana; ABB genome type) provides a functional nutrient in health promotion products and is a source of various probiotics.

The aim of this study is to investigate the cholesterol-removing ability of 5 LAB strains isolated from raw M. sapientum. All tested strains show a cholesterol-lowering property in species-and strain-dependent manner, with Weissella paramesenteroides NR27 being the most effective probiotic in reducing cholesterol concentration (P < 0.001). The removal of cholesterol by LAB is partially due to the production of bile salt hydrolase. All tested isolates exhibit more than 75% and 50% survival rates after challenging with simulated gastric and intestinal fluids respectively. Of these, W. paramesenteroides NR27 has a significantly higher survival rate (80%) in gastrointestinal conditions (P < 0.001), compared with all tested strains. In addition, antibiotic-resistant genes are not present in all drugs tested on this isolate. Therefore, W. paramesenteroides NR27 could be a promising probiotic candidate for reducing total cholesterol.\",\n",

In addition to true seed eaters, a suite of insects feed on the fleshy parts of fruits. We examined the likelihood of community convergence in whole insect assemblages attacking seeds/fruits in three tropical rain forests. Location: Three ForestGEO permanent forest plots within different biogeographical regions: Barro Colorado Island (Panama), Khao Chong (Thailand) and Wanang (Papua New Guinea). Methods: We surveyed 1,186 plant species and reared 1.1 ton of seeds/fruits that yielded 80,600 insects representing at least 1,678 species. We assigned seeds/fruits to predation syndromes on the basis of plant traits relevant to insects, seed/fruit appearance and mesocarp thickness. Results: We observed large differences in insect faunal composition, species richness and guild structure between our three study sites. We hypothesize that the high species richness of insect feeding on seeds/fruits in Panama may result from a conjunction of low plant species richness and high availability of dry fruits. Insect assemblages were weakly influenced by seed predation syndromes, both at the local and regional scale, and the effect of host phylogeny varied also among sites. At the driest site (Panama), the probability of seeds of a plant species being attacked depended more on seed availability than on the measured seed traits of that plant species. However, when seeds were attacked, plant traits shaping insect assemblages were difficult to identify and not related to seed availability. Main conclusions: We observed only weak evidence of community convergence at the intercontinental scale among these assemblages. Our study suggests that seed eaters may be most commonly associated with dry fruits at relatively dry tropical sites where fleshy fruits may be less prevalent.\",\n",
