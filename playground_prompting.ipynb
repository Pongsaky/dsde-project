      "    \"abstract\": \"Background: Fruit ripening is an intricate developmental process driven by a highly coordinated action of complex hormonal networks. Ethylene is considered as the main phytohormone that regulates the ripening of climacteric fruits. Concomitantly, several ethylene-responsive transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal components of the regulatory network underlying fruit ripening. Calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) is one such ethylene-induced TF implicated in various stress and plant developmental processes. Results: Our comprehensive analysis of the CAMTA gene family in Durio zibethinus (durian, Dz) identified 10 CAMTAs with conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis of DzCAMTAs, positioned DzCAMTA3 with its tomato ortholog that has already been validated for its role in the fruit ripening process through ethylene-mediated signaling. Furthermore, the transcriptome-wide analysis revealed DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 as the highest expressing durian CAMTA genes. These two DzCAMTAs possessed a distinct ripening-associated expression pattern during post-harvest ripening in Monthong, a durian cultivar native to Thailand. The expression profiling of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 under natural ripening conditions and ethylene-induced/delayed ripening conditions substantiated their roles as ethylene-induced transcriptional activators of ripening. Similarly, auxin-suppressed expression of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 confirmed their responsiveness to exogenous auxin treatment in a time-dependent manner. Accordingly, we propose that DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 synergistically crosstalk with ethylene during durian fruit ripening. In contrast, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 antagonistically with auxin could affect the post-harvest ripening process in durian. Furthermore, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 interacting genes contain significant CAMTA recognition motifs and regulated several pivotal fruit-ripening-associated pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, the present study contributes to an in-depth understanding of the structure and probable function of CAMTA genes in the post-harvest ripening of durian.\",\n",

The cellulose from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was extracted to prepare the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) used as the starting material for synthesizing CMC-based hydrogel for the selective adsorption of Cu(II) ions in contaminated solution. Hydrogel fabrication was performed under microwave-assisted irradiation, which helps to improve reaction efficiency and significantly reduces reaction time compared with using a conventional hotplate. The hydrogel of 25% CMC blended with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a cross-linking agent showed the property of selective adsorption for Cu(II) ions from the solution with an adsorption capacity of 2.3 mg/g (92.4% removal) under ambient temperature with pH 5.0. The adsorbed Cu(II) ions were effectively desorbed from the hydrogel by either 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M EDTA. Thus, the prepared hydrogel could potentially be applied in the removal of Cu(II) ions from contaminated water, with promising potential for reuse after the regeneration process. Sugarcane bagasse was used as a starting material for the synthesis of hydrogel, which has selective adsorption property to Cu(II) ions. In addition, microwave-assisted irradiation, technology that is able to save time and energy, was exploited for the polymer synthesis. Therefore, this study presents the sustainable applications of recycling agricultural waste for the purpose of water treatment. \\u00a9 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: S157\\u2013S165, 2019.\",\n",

Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced.

However, the\\nblackberry (Rubus fruticosus) fruit does not show obvious and reliable visible\\ntraits of ripeness when mature and therefore poses great difficulty to fruit\\npickers. The mature blackberry, to the human eye, is black before, during, and\\npost-ripening. To address this engineering application challenge, this paper\\nproposes a novel multi-input convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble\\nclassifier for detecting subtle traits of ripeness in blackberry fruits. The\\nmulti-input CNN was created from a pre-trained visual geometry group 16-layer\\ndeep convolutional network (VGG16) model trained on the ImageNet dataset. The\\nfully connected layers were optimized for learning traits of ripeness of mature\\nblackberry fruits. The resulting model served as the base for building\\nhomogeneous ensemble learners that were ensemble using the stack generalization\\nensemble (SGE) framework. The input to the network is images acquired with a\\nstereo sensor using visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectral filters at\\nwavelengths of 700 nm and 770 nm. Through experiments, the proposed model\\nachieved 95.1% accuracy on unseen sets and 90.2% accuracy with in-field\\nconditions.

Thus to fulfill those requirements\\nmultimedia data is needed. In this paper we present a robust multi-support and\\nmodular Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) platform, which is a type of\\nwireless sensor network equipped with a low cost CCD camera. This WMSN platform\\nmay be used for diverse environmental event detections such as the presence of\\nplant diseases and insects in precision agriculture applications.\\n\",\n",
