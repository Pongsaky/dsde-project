The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

For examining the effects of BAN energy gel, eleven Thai male runners (aged 27.36\\u00b18.89 years and VO2 max 69.43\\u00b112.69 ml/kg/min) participated in this study to investigate Time To Exhaustion (TTE). TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

The firmness of fruits treated at 50oC was higher than that of untreated fruits, and physiological changes including fresh weight loss, ethylene production, total soluble solid content, and peel color were also prevented. Treatment at 55oC slowed softening, but induced peel damage and failure to develop a normal color. Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced. Structural alteration to the peel was also slower than in untreated fruits. The study clarified the effect of hot water treatment on alteration of the cell wall structure and composition of banana fruit during postharvest storage.\",\n",

HMW-CTS expressed the highest ability to reduce respiration rate and ethylene production of the fruit and preserved fruit firmness by inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes including polygalacturonase and pectate lyase activities which play an important role in pectin degradation. Additionally, HMW-CTS influenced a decrease in disease severity and cell membrane injury in relation to low malondialdehyde content and high antioxidant activities of coated fruit.

In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing fruit extracts derived from banana peel and juice to reduce graphene oxide. After the reduction, the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide are effectively removed, and the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon bonding networks are restored, as evidenced by the characterization using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our banana extracts would offer a promising pathway for realizing cheap, safe, and environmentally friendly reducing agents for the upscale production of reduced graphene oxide.\",\n",

BAN has a long history of use as a nutritional supplement and medical food due to its beneficial nutritional and therapeutic effects. Being an ergogenic aid, BAN has shown significant changes in the lipid profile, muscle and liver glycogen, enzyme activity, and Nitric Oxide (NO) activity inhibition, which results in prolonged exercise time. The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\\\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

BAN has a long history of use as a nutritional supplement and medical food due to its beneficial nutritional and therapeutic effects. Being an ergogenic aid, BAN has shown significant changes in the lipid profile, muscle and liver glycogen, enzyme activity, and Nitric Oxide (NO) activity inhibition, which results in prolonged exercise time. The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

For examining the effects of BAN energy gel, eleven Thai male runners (aged 27.36\\u00b18.89 years and VO2 max 69.43\\u00b112.69 ml/kg/min) participated in this study to investigate Time To Exhaustion (TTE). TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05). This study found that BAN energy gel can prolong time to exhaustion. Therefore, BAN energy gel can be used as an ergogenic aid for runners, which is suitable to be consumed before and during the competition\",\n",

The firmness of fruits treated at 50oC was higher than that of untreated fruits, and physiological changes including fresh weight loss, ethylene production, total soluble solid content, and peel color were also prevented. Treatment at 55oC slowed softening, but induced peel damage and failure to develop a normal color. Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced. Structural alteration to the peel was also slower than in untreated fruits.

HMW-CTS expressed the highest ability to reduce respiration rate and ethylene production of the fruit and preserved fruit firmness by inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes including polygalacturonase and pectate lyase activities which play an important role in pectin degradation. Additionally, HMW-CTS influenced a decrease in disease severity and cell membrane injury in relation to low malondialdehyde content and high antioxidant activities of coated fruit. The overall results suggest that HMW-CTS is a promising postharvest chitosan coating in maintaining fruit firmness and extending the shelf life of \\u2018Hom Thong\\u2019 banana fruit after harvest.\",\n",

The compounds were characterized and quantified using NMR, Mass Spectroscopy (MS) and HPLC. A crude ethanolic extract of 124 g, containing 5.3 % of rutin, was obtained from 1 kg of dried banana leaf powder. After a series of solvent partition separations, the product from partitions using hexane/dichloromethane and dichloromethane/water in sequence contained a rutin content of 40.6 %. Purification using a Sephadex column yielded fractions with purity of rutin up to 74\\u201384 % and further purification using semi-preparative RP-HPLC produced a final product with a yield of rutin of 32.4 mg/g of the crude extracts and a purity of 98.4 %.

In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing fruit extracts derived from banana peel and juice to reduce graphene oxide. After the reduction, the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide are effectively removed, and the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon bonding networks are restored, as evidenced by the characterization using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our banana extracts would offer a promising pathway for realizing cheap, safe, and environmentally friendly reducing agents for the upscale production of reduced graphene oxide.\",\n",

For the postharvest experiment, CTS and CTS supplemented with CTS-MMT nanocomposite solutions were applied as banana fruit coating by the dipping technique. The CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT showed a significant retarding in peel color change, reduced electrolyte leakage, and MDA content, while CTS coating could maintain fruit firmness and reduce plasma membrane destruction for only the first few days.

We show that seeding successful folding in\\nthis way can be understood in terms of sub-patterns that fold when cut out\\n(`folding islands').

The ratio of the average number of stickers needed to fill the\\nalbum by the album size (number of different stickers needed) and the number of\\ncollectors as well as the ratio of the variance and the album size depend\\napproximately only on the percentage of replacement stickers (the limited\\nnumber of stickers that can be bought directly from the vendor) and the number\\nof collectors, but not on the total album size. Thus collectors can estimate\\nthe average cost of completion of an album and its standard deviation just\\nbased on basic calculations and a table lookup.

      "    \"abstract\": \"  This article extends the range of 1-DOF rigid-foldable developable\\nquadrilateral creased papers. In a previous article, we put forward a\\nsufficient and necessary condition for a quadrilateral creased paper to be\\nrigid-foldable, and introduce a special sufficient condition that is convenient\\nfor practical use, generating quadrilateral creased paper by stitching basic\\nunits. In this article we develop new flat-foldable units and show how these\\ncan be used to construct a series of more complex rigid-foldable developable\\nquadrilateral creased papers.\\n\",\n",

As we show, this is\\npossible for a tree if and only if the internal vertices of the tree all have\\neven degree greater than two. However, we prove that (for unbounded sheets of\\npaper, with a vertex at infinity representing a shared endpoint of all creased\\nrays) the graph of a folding pattern must be 2-vertex-connected and\\n4-edge-connected.\\n\",\n",
