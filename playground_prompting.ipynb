BAN has a long history of use as a nutritional supplement and medical food due to its beneficial nutritional and therapeutic effects.

The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

Treatment at 55oC slowed softening, but induced peel damage and failure to develop a normal color. Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced. Structural alteration to the peel was also slower than in untreated fruits. The study clarified the effect of hot water treatment on alteration of the cell wall structure and composition of banana fruit during postharvest storage.\",\n",

Replacing conventional reducing agents, such as NaBH4 and hydrazine, with cheap, widely available, safe, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-prepare reducing agents is a key to large-scale commercial production of reduced graphene oxide. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing fruit extracts derived from banana peel and juice to reduce graphene oxide. After the reduction, the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide are effectively removed, and the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon bonding networks are restored, as evidenced by the characterization using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our banana extracts would offer a promising pathway for realizing cheap, safe, and environmentally friendly reducing agents for the upscale production of reduced graphene oxide.\",\n",

HMW-CTS expressed the highest ability to reduce respiration rate and ethylene production of the fruit and preserved fruit firmness by inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes including polygalacturonase and pectate lyase activities which play an important role in pectin degradation. Additionally, HMW-CTS influenced a decrease in disease severity and cell membrane injury in relation to low malondialdehyde content and high antioxidant activities of coated fruit. The overall results suggest that HMW-CTS is a promising postharvest chitosan coating in maintaining fruit firmness and extending the shelf life of \\u2018Hom Thong\\u2019 banana fruit after harvest.\",\n",

After a series of solvent partition separations, the product from partitions using hexane/dichloromethane and dichloromethane/water in sequence contained a rutin content of 40.6 %. Purification using a Sephadex column yielded fractions with purity of rutin up to 74\\u201384 % and further purification using semi-preparative RP-HPLC produced a final product with a yield of rutin of 32.4 mg/g of the crude extracts and a purity of 98.4 %.

The CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT showed a significant retarding in peel color change, reduced electrolyte leakage, and MDA content, while CTS coating could maintain fruit firmness and reduce plasma membrane destruction for only the first few days.

The spanwise\\nflow over the modified airfoil interacts with the primary flow. The turbulent\\nseparation gets delayed compared to the unmodified airfoil, thereby\\nsignificantly improving the stall behavior and flow behavior in the post-stall\\nregion. The modified airfoil provides the gradual stall behavior against the\\nsteep stall behavior for the unmodified airfoil. To optimize tubercle\\nconfiguration, the study considers two modified airfoils with different\\ncombinations of amplitude and wavelength.

      "    \"abstract\": \"  The study of cavity flow is one of the most important research topics of\\nunsteady aerodynamics. Supersonic turbulent flows over a cavity are mostly\\nencountered in missiles, turbomachinery, and high-speed aircraft. The\\nturbulence inside the cavity gives rise to excess drag, acoustic waves,\\npressure fluctuations, and vibrations which may lead to numerous problems like\\nexcess fuel consumption, failure of missile trajectory or mechanical parts, and\\naerodynamic heating. We conduct numerical simulations to investigate the flow\\nand compare our results to existing experimental data to show quantitative\\nvalidation. We then investigate the effect of the Mach number of the turbulent\\nsupersonic flow on the pressure contours and the vortical structures inside the\\ncavity and the subsequent effect on other flow parameters like acoustic waves.\\nThereafter, we propose two modifications of the cavity geometry, a) slanted\\nedges and b) smoothened corners with slanted edges, to improve the aerodynamic\\nperformance. ANSYS ICEM tool has been used for the fine mesh generation of our\\ncavity geometry and all the simulation was run on ANSYS fluent software. The K\\nomega SST turbulence model was used for the simulation as it can capture the\\nnear wall property with reasonable accuracy and a grid independence study was\\ncarried out to find the correct solution of the Navier Stokes equation was\\nproceeding by the solver. The parameters like pressure contours, streamline\\npattern, coefficient of pressure distribution and sound pressure level (SPL)\\nhas been found and compared for both modified and unmodified open cavity at\\ndifferent Mach number.

For comparison reasons, unsteady calculations are performed using\\\\nmode-by-mode and simultaneous excitation approaches. System identification\\\\ntechniques are employed to allow the splitting of the aerodynamic coefficient\\\\ntime histories into the contribution of each individual mode to the\\\\ncorresponding aerodynamic transfer function. Such methodology is applied to\\\\nmodel the aerodynamic terms of the aeroelastic state-space system particularly\\\\nof a NACA 0012 airfoil-based typical section.

The turbulent\\\\nseparation gets delayed compared to the unmodified airfoil, thereby\\\\nsignificantly improving the stall behavior and flow behavior in the post-stall\\\\nregion. The modified airfoil provides the gradual stall behavior against the\\\\nsteep stall behavior for the unmodified airfoil. To optimize tubercle\\\\nconfiguration, the study considers two modified airfoils with different\\\\ncombinations of amplitude and wavelength.
