The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

For examining the effects of BAN energy gel, eleven Thai male runners (aged 27.36\\u00b18.89 years and VO2 max 69.43\\u00b112.69 ml/kg/min) participated in this study to investigate Time To Exhaustion (TTE). TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

Gel containing 15% w/w of starch was prepared from rice starch, tapioca starch or blended rice starch/tapioca starch (1:0.85 w/w) mixed with water, 45oBx sucrose solution or coconut milk. The result showed that rice starch gel stored at 4 \\u00b0C had highest hardness, degree of syneresis and melting enthalpy of the retrograded structure (\\u0394Hret). Degree of syneresis of frozen rice starch gels subjected to several freezing-thawing cycles was also highest. Under chilled temperature storage, starch gels containing sucrose or coconut milk had higher hardness and denser gel structure, comparing to the starch gels in water. This textural change was due to greater degree of starch retrogradation, sucrose recrystallization and/or formation of amylose-lipid complex crystallites shown in X-ray diffractograms. However, addition of highly concentrated sucrose or coconut milk increased freeze-thaw stability of the frozen starch gels, as shown by decreasing degree of syneresis.

Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness.

The catalyst was calcined at several temperatures between 550\\u2013650 \\u00b0C under atmosphere pressure for 4 h. The composition, structure and texture of the calcined banana peel (CBP) catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The fatty acid profile of the feed soybean oil and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) product composition was analyzed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The prepared catalysts were then applied for the catalytic transesterification of soybean oil with methanol under microwave-assisted heating to form FAME. The effect of the calcination temperature in the catalyst preparation, the catalyst loading level, reaction time, methanol: soybean oil molar ratio and catalyst reusability on the FAME yield were determined by univariate analysis. The CBP catalyst synthesized at 600 \\u00b0C exhibited the highest catalytic activity, since the calcined ash was rich in K, P, Ca and Mg which formed a basic heterogenous catalyst at this calcination temperature. At the determined optimal reaction condition (1 wt.% catalyst loading level, 12:1 molar ratio of methanol: soybean oil, and a 2 min of reaction time under 300 W microwave irradiation) a FAME yield of 99.3% was obtained. Furthermore, the catalyst showed a good reusability with a biodiesel yield of more than 80.7% after four uses.\",\n",

The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\\\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed.

The composition, structure and texture of the calcined banana peel (CBP) catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The fatty acid profile of the feed soybean oil and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) product composition was analyzed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The prepared catalysts were then applied for the catalytic transesterification of soybean oil with methanol under microwave-assisted heating to form FAME. The effect of the calcination temperature in the catalyst preparation, the catalyst loading level, reaction time, methanol: soybean oil molar ratio and catalyst reusability on the FAME yield were determined by univariate analysis. The CBP catalyst synthesized at 600 \\\\u00b0C exhibited the highest catalytic activity, since the calcined ash was rich in K, P, Ca and Mg which formed a basic heterogenous catalyst at this calcination temperature. At the determined optimal reaction condition (1 wt.% catalyst loading level, 12:1 molar ratio of methanol: soybean oil, and a 2 min of reaction time under 300 W microwave irradiation) a FAME yield of 99.3% was obtained. Furthermore, the catalyst showed a good reusability with a biodiesel yield of more than 80.7% after four uses.\",\\n    \"authors\": [\\n        \"Jakkrapong Jitjamnong\",\\n        \" Chachchaya Thunyaratchatanon\",\\n        \" Apanee Luengnaruemitchai\",\\n        \" Napaphat Kongrit\",\\n        \" Naparat Kasetsomboon\",\\n        \" Narinphop Chuaykarn\",\\n        \" Nonlapan Khantikulanon\",\\n        \" \"\\n    ],\\n    \"source\": \"scopus\"\\n}\\n\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='ff72509b-df1e-4d42-b67d-f4f8c19cb540'),\n",

The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05).

Gel containing 15% w/w of starch was prepared from rice starch, tapioca starch or blended rice starch/tapioca starch (1:0.85 w/w) mixed with water, 45oBx sucrose solution or coconut milk. The result showed that rice starch gel stored at 4 \\u00b0C had highest hardness, degree of syneresis and melting enthalpy of the retrograded structure (\\u0394Hret). Degree of syneresis of frozen rice starch gels subjected to several freezing-thawing cycles was also highest. Under chilled temperature storage, starch gels containing sucrose or coconut milk had higher hardness and denser gel structure, comparing to the starch gels in water. This textural change was due to greater degree of starch retrogradation, sucrose recrystallization and/or formation of amylose-lipid complex crystallites shown in X-ray diffractograms. However, addition of highly concentrated sucrose or coconut milk increased freeze-thaw stability of the frozen starch gels, as shown by decreasing degree of syneresis.

Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced. Structural alteration to the peel was also slower than in untreated fruits. The study clarified the effect of hot water treatment on alteration of the cell wall structure and composition of banana fruit during postharvest storage.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This research aims to study encapsulation efficiency of cell probiotics by using Konjac glucomannan hydrolysate (KGMH) under spray drying. KGMH was prepared from Konjac glucomannan solution (KGMS) at different concentrations. Lactobacillus casei was used in this study as it is commonly used in food industry and resistance to heat. The effect of wall material (HGMH) concentration on encapsulation efficiency of the cell probiotic was evaluated. Probiotics culture was prepared by inoculating in sterile MRS broth and incubated at 37\\u00b0C for 48 hours, the cells were harvested in the early stationary phase. Konjac glucomannan solution was hydrolysed by mannanase at 40\\u00b0C for 4 hours. Then, probiotic solution (10 log CFU/ml) was mixed with KGMH at concentration of 15%, 20% and 25% (w/w). Spray drying condition was kept at constant inlet air temperature of 170\\u00b0C, outlet air temperature of 85\\u00b0C and feed flow rate of 10 mL min-l. Encapsulated probiotic with KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) exhibited the highest encapsulation efficiency (95.4 %), water activity of 0.198 and moisture content of 4.38 % (w.b.). For application in ice cream, microcapsules of probiotic encapsulated with KGMH at concentration of 25% with and without 10% (w/w) trehalose were then mixed into milk ice cream separately. The ice cream was stored at -18\\u00b0C for one month. The survival rate of microencapsulated probiotic cells and free cells probiotics in the ice cream were measured. It was found that microcapsule of KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) with 10% (w/w) trehalose gave higher survival rate of probiotics cell (> 90%) in ice cream under freezing temperature than KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) and free cell probiotics during storage, respectively.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In the present study, a novel solid base catalyst derived from desert banana (Musa sapientum Linn) peels was used as a catalyst for biodiesel production. The catalyst was calcined at several temperatures between 550\\u2013650 \\u00b0C under atmosphere pressure for 4 h. The composition, structure and texture of the calcined banana peel (CBP) catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The fatty acid profile of the feed soybean oil and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) product composition was analyzed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The prepared catalysts were then applied for the catalytic transesterification of soybean oil with methanol under microwave-assisted heating to form FAME. The effect of the calcination temperature in the catalyst preparation, the catalyst loading level, reaction time, methanol: soybean oil molar ratio and catalyst reusability on the FAME yield were determined by univariate analysis. The CBP catalyst synthesized at 600 \\u00b0C exhibited the highest catalytic activity, since the calcined ash was rich in K, P, Ca and Mg which formed a basic heterogenous catalyst at this calcination temperature. At the determined optimal reaction condition (1 wt.% catalyst loading level, 12:1 molar ratio of methanol: soybean oil, and a 2 min of reaction time under 300 W microwave irradiation) a FAME yield of 99.3% was obtained. Furthermore, the catalyst showed a good reusability with a biodiesel yield of more than 80.7% after four uses.\",\n",
