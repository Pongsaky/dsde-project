BAN has a long history of use as a nutritional supplement and medical food due to its beneficial nutritional and therapeutic effects.

The objectives of this study were to develop a BAN energy gel and examine the effects of BAN energy gel on endurance running performance. The nutrition values of the developed BAN energy gel, glucose, sucrose, fructose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, protein, fat, ash, and total carbohydrate were assessed. The BAN energy gel nutrition values were 1.20\\u00b10.02 (g), 8.77\\u00b10.08 (g), 1.31\\u00b10.01 (g), 25.67\\u00b10.13 (mg), 184.83\\u00b10.54 (mg), 14.07\\u00b10.09 (mg), 0.43\\u00b10.08 (g), 0.14 \\u00b10.02 (%), 1.23\\u00b10.19 (g), 0.55\\u00b10.01 (g), 15.95\\u00b10.21 (%) per 100 g sample, respectively.

For examining the effects of BAN energy gel, eleven Thai male runners (aged 27.36\\u00b18.89 years and VO2 max 69.43\\u00b112.69 ml/kg/min) participated in this study to investigate Time To Exhaustion (TTE). TTE in subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly longer than in subjects who consumed placebo (PLA) (55.23\\u00b110.32 min. vs. 46.13\\u00b19.87 min). The potassium level in the blood of subjects who consumed BAN energy gel was significantly higher than in subjects who consumed PLA (p<.05). This study found that BAN energy gel can prolong time to exhaustion. Therefore, BAN energy gel can be used as an ergogenic aid for runners, which is suitable to be consumed before and during the competition\",\n",

Treatment at 55oC slowed softening, but induced peel damage and failure to develop a normal color. Investigation of the cell wall composition and structure following treatment at 50oC showed a delay in the increase of water-soluble pectin, correlated with fruit firmness. A higher level of HCl-soluble pectin was detected in treated fruits, indicating that cell wall polymer solubilization had been reduced. Structural alteration to the peel was also slower than in untreated fruits. The study clarified the effect of hot water treatment on alteration of the cell wall structure and composition of banana fruit during postharvest storage.\",\n",

Replacing conventional reducing agents, such as NaBH4 and hydrazine, with cheap, widely available, safe, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-prepare reducing agents is a key to large-scale commercial production of reduced graphene oxide. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing fruit extracts derived from banana peel and juice to reduce graphene oxide. After the reduction, the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide are effectively removed, and the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon bonding networks are restored, as evidenced by the characterization using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our banana extracts would offer a promising pathway for realizing cheap, safe, and environmentally friendly reducing agents for the upscale production of reduced graphene oxide.\",\n",

HMW-CTS expressed the highest ability to reduce respiration rate and ethylene production of the fruit and preserved fruit firmness by inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes including polygalacturonase and pectate lyase activities which play an important role in pectin degradation. Additionally, HMW-CTS influenced a decrease in disease severity and cell membrane injury in relation to low malondialdehyde content and high antioxidant activities of coated fruit. The overall results suggest that HMW-CTS is a promising postharvest chitosan coating in maintaining fruit firmness and extending the shelf life of \\u2018Hom Thong\\u2019 banana fruit after harvest.\",\n",

After a series of solvent partition separations, the product from partitions using hexane/dichloromethane and dichloromethane/water in sequence contained a rutin content of 40.6 %. Purification using a Sephadex column yielded fractions with purity of rutin up to 74\\u201384 % and further purification using semi-preparative RP-HPLC produced a final product with a yield of rutin of 32.4 mg/g of the crude extracts and a purity of 98.4 %.
