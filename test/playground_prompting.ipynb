    "A \"Keyword\" is a short word related to the topic, title, or field of the user’s input message.\n",

In this\\nwork, an analytical formulation is proposed for the force and moment\\ncalculation in the presence of the ground and taking the aircraft attitude and\\nsink rate into account. The aerodynamic coefficients are firstly calculated for\\na representative vehicle and its characteristics in ground effect are\\ninvestigated.

The\\ncoupled fluid-flexible wing system is solved by a body-fitted variational\\naeroelastic solver based on the fully-coupled Navier-Stokes and nonlinear\\nstructural equations. Using the coupled fluid-structure analysis, this study is\\naimed to provide physical insight and correlations for the aeroelastic behavior\\nof flexible wings in the parameter space of the angle of attack and the\\naeroelastic number. The phase diagrams of the aerodynamic performance are\\nestablished to obtain the envelope curves of the optimal performance and\\ndetermine the transition line of the drag variation. The effects of the angle\\nof attack and the aeroelastic number on the aeroelastic behaviors are\\nsystematically examined. The time-averaged membrane deformation is positively\\ncorrelated with a non-dimensional number, the so-called Weber number. A new\\nscaling relation is proposed based on the dynamic equilibrium between the\\naerodynamic force fluctuation and the combined inertia-elastic fluctuation. The\\nunsteady aerodynamic force can be adjusted by manipulating the membrane\\nvibration, the mass ratio, the Strouhal number and the aeroelastic number. The\\nnumerical investigations provide design guidelines and have the potential to\\nenhance the maneuverability and flight agility of micro air vehicles with\\nflexible wing structures.\\n\",\n",

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations are based on\\nthe Euler equations and the code uses a finite volume formulation for general\\nunstructured grids. A centered spatial discretization with added artificial\\ndissipation is used, and an explicit Runge-Kutta time marching method is\\nemployed. For comparison reasons, unsteady calculations are performed using\\nmode-by-mode and simultaneous excitation approaches. System identification\\ntechniques are employed to allow the splitting of the aerodynamic coefficient\\ntime histories into the contribution of each individual mode to the\\ncorresponding aerodynamic transfer function. Such methodology is applied to\\nmodel the aerodynamic terms of the aeroelastic state-space system particularly\\nof a NACA 0012 airfoil-based typical section. Results demonstrate the\\nimportance of signal processing techniques to compute the aerodynamic transfer\\nfunctions and also the advantageous applicability of transonic unsteady\\naerodynamic reduced-order models to perform aeroelastic analyses in the\\nfrequency domain.\\n\",\n",

The spanwise\\nflow over the modified airfoil interacts with the primary flow. The turbulent\\nseparation gets delayed compared to the unmodified airfoil, thereby\\nsignificantly improving the stall behavior and flow behavior in the post-stall\\nregion. The modified airfoil provides the gradual stall behavior against the\\nsteep stall behavior for the unmodified airfoil. To optimize tubercle\\nconfiguration, the study considers two modified airfoils with different\\ncombinations of amplitude and wavelength.

The initial policy for reinforcement\\nlearning is pretrained through imitation learning, and the result is compared\\nwith randomly generated initial policies.
